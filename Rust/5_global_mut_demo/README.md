# Global Mut Demo

**This project use different ways to demostrate how to use global mutatble variables without relying on unsafe feature like `static mut`**

**Crate used:**
1. lazy_static
2. once_cell
3. rand

Currently this is yet another text based game but boring as hell. You can only enter "A/a" to attack and enter "S/s" to show game progress.
While enemies doesn't not fight back and can be killed in one shot, character cannot level up as well.
