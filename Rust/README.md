*** Rust-Diary ***

### I Love Rust ###

## First Stage: Getting inspration from (most downloaded crates in crates.io)[https://crates.io/crates?sort=downloads] ##

This part of repository record the proccess of me learning Rust-lang from the ground up,
because I'm still new to Rust-lang, it is highly possible for me to messed up the coding 
especially its formats, SO... Please forgive me and kindly point out my mistakes, thanks~
