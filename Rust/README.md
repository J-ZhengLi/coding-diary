### First Stage: ###
  Getting inspration from most downloaded crates in (crates.io)[https://crates.io/crates?sort=downloads]

This part of repository record the proccess of me learning Rust-lang from the ground up,
since I'm (or was) new to Rust-lang, it is highly possible for me to messed up the coding 
especially its formats, SO... Please forgive me and kindly point out my mistakes~
