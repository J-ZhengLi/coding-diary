# Rust

## Introduction:
  Some fun projects built with Rust programming language.

  Just noted that these projects were made for fun thus might not offering any real world usages,
  but they might be helpful for beginners like I was (and still am), who want to try Rust-lang but the real world production examples might
  be too hard to understand.

  Each project should be very small containing at most a few hundred lines of code, with commonly used crates dependencies, so it should be fairly easy to understand...

## Requirement(s):

* rustup

## Getting started:

Add a project:

```bash
cargo dev new <NAME>
```

Remove a project:

```bash
cargo dev del <PATH>
```

Check `cargo dev help` for more information. or run:

```bash
cargo run -p helper help
```
