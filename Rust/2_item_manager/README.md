# Item Manager

**This project is a demo of procedural macro**

**Crate used:**
1. syn
2. quote

Currently this project has only 'derive' type macro, which includes struct builder, custom display macro.

Note: I'll admit it has a lot flaws and doesn't not give espected result, but I've spent too much time on this subject and unfortunately I decided to moving on with this project.
