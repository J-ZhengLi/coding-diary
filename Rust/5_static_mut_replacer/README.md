# Static Mut Replacments

**This project use different ways to demostrate how to use global mutatble variables without relying on unsafe feature like `static mut`**

I somehow think this is a nice way to learn the use of crates like `lazy_static` and `once_cell`, while also getting into multi-thread 
programming with Rust.
