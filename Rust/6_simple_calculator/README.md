# Simple Calculator

**This project is a demo app that takes mathmatical expression as input and then evaluates it**

**Crate Used:**
None (The plan to use [num-traits](https://crates.io/crates/num-traits), but later I realized that the functionality of this simple app doesn't need it.)

A calculator that supporting basic operations including:
1. Addition(+)
2. Subtraction(-)
3. Multiplication(*)
4. Division(/)
5. Power(^)
as well as some operations that a not that common:
1. Absolution(abs())
2. Square Root(sqrt())
3. Cosine(cos())
4. Sine(sin())
5. Tangent(tan())
6. Arc cosine(arccos())
6. Arc sine(arcsin())
6. Arc tangent(arctan())

If I have more time I will be adding more functionalities throught the `calculator_util` submodule.
