*** A Very Basic Gotcha System ***

This project is a demo using the 'rand' crate.

## Why am I still here, just to suffer ##

I've been falling into the gotcha hell since a long time, 
I love the excitment of getting something I want, but hate it when I got something that is completely garbage.

Unfortunately that's how gotcha game works and it often requires a load of money, 
since I have none, I might as well creating my own~
